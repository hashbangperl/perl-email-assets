=head1 DESCRIPION

Simple to use library for file assets in email, allowing you to link using cid or inline, with export
to MIME::Lite message parts

=head1 SYNOPSIS

   use Email::Assets;

   my $assets = Email::Assets->new( base => [ $uri_root, $dir_root ] );

   # Email::Assets will automatically detect the type based on the extension
   my $asset = $assets->include("/static/foo.gif");

   # or

   my $asset = $assets->include_base64( $image_base64 );

   # This asset won't get attached twice, as Email::Assets will ignore repeats of a path
   my $cid = $assets->include("/static/foo.gif")->cid;

   # Or you can iterate (in order)
   for my $asset ($assets->exports) {
     print $asset->cid, "\n";
     my $mime_part = $asset->as_mime_part;
  }

..or in a template :

  <img src="cid://[% assets.include('static/foo.gif').cid %]">
  [% # or %]
  <img src="data:[% assets.include('static/foo.gif', {inline_only => 1}).inline_data">

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 mime_types

MIME::Types object

=head2 base

arrayref of paths to find files in

=head1 METHODS

=head2 include

Add an asset, takes filename (required), then optional hashref of options (inline_only currently only one supported), returns Email::Assets::File object

=head2 include_base64

Object method. Adds an asset already encoded in base64, returns that asset.

Takes string holding base64 encoded file, filename, then optional hashref of options:

=over 4

=item inline_only - exclude asset from to_mime_parts, to avoid adding un-necessary size & attachments

=item url_encoded - base64 encoding is "url safe" so use base64url decoder, and re-encode for MIME::Lite, etc as not suited for most email use.

=back

Returns Email::Assets::File object.

=head2 exports

Get all assets, returns list of Email::Assets::File objects

=head2 get

Get an asset by name, takes relative path, returns Email::Assets::File object

=head2 to_mime_parts

Returns assets that aren't inline_only as MIME::Lite objects
